## Dataset

### Dataset split

We spilt FineDance dataset into train, val and test sets in two ways: FineDance@Genre and  FineDance@Dancer.
1. The test set of FineDance@Genre includes a broader range of dance genres, but the same dancer appear in  train/val/test set.
2. The train/val/test set of FineDance@Dancer was divided by different dancers, which test set contains fewer dance genres, yet the same dancer won't appear in different sets.
