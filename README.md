## Dataset

# Dataset split
We spilt FineDance dataset into train, val and test sets in two ways: FineDance@Genre and  FineDance@Dancer. The test set of FineDance@Genre includes a broader range of dance genres, but the same dancer appear in  train/val/test set. FineDance@Dancer means the train/val/test set divided by different dancers, which test set contains fewer dance genres, yet the same dancer won't appear in different sets. We only reported the results of test set on FineDance@Genre in this paper, the details of dataset split and experiments results of FineDance@Dancer can be found in our supplementary materials.
